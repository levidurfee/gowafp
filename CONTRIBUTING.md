# Contributing

All help is welcome! If you want to write tests, add features, or help in
another way, feel free to do so.

## Issues

We'll use Issues to keep track of feature requests, bugs, and other ideas. Don't
be afraid to open a issue about anything, as long as it is somewhat related to
this repo.

## Pull Requests

If you create an issue, then want to contribute code, please open a pull request
and mention the issue #. If you're adding a new code, please make sure it is
tested, unless you need help with that part; then let us know.
